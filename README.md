## Demo Environment provisioning

We will be using an example microservices, where we have two main namespace "Simpson" and "Bouvier"
and two microservices deployed in each namespace:

Marge and Homer microservices will be running in the Simpson namespace and Selma and Patty microservices will be running in the Bouvier namespace.

* Provision Namespace and ArgoProjects for the demo:

```sh
oc apply -k argo-projects/
```

NOTE: if you deployed in the early exercise this application, you can skip to the Egress Firewall step directly.

* Login to the ArgoCD Server:

```sh
echo https://$(oc get route openshift-gitops-server -n openshift-gitops -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}{"\n"}')
```

* Use admin user with the password:

```sh
oc get secret/openshift-gitops-cluster -n openshift-gitops -o jsonpath='\''{.data.admin\.password}'\'' | base64 -d
```

NOTE: you can also login using the Openshift SSO because it's enabled using Dex OIDC integration.

* Deploy the ApplicationSet containing the Applications to be secured:

```sh
oc apply -f argo-apps/dev-env-apps.yaml
```

* Check that the applications are deployed properly in ArgoCD:

* Check the pods are up && running:

```sh
oc get pods -o wide -n simpson
oc get pods -o wide -n bouvier
```

* Check that the apps are working properly:

```sh
oc -n bouvier exec -ti deploy/patty-deployment -- ./container-helper check
oc -n bouvier exec -ti deploy/selma-deployment -- ./container-helper check
oc -n simpson exec -ti deploy/homer-deployment -- ./container-helper check
oc -n simpson exec -ti deploy/selma-deployment -- ./container-helper check
```

* You can check each Argo Application in ArgoCD:

* As you can check all the communications are allowed between microservices:

```sh
marge.simpson             : 1
selma.bouvier             : 1
patty.bouvier             : 1
```

the 1, means that the traffic is OK, and the 0 are the NOK.
