# Demo 6 - Implementing Network Security Zones in OpenShift

## Demo Environment provisioning

We will be using an example microservices, where we have two main namespace "Simpson" and "Bouvier"
and two microservices deployed in each namespace:

Marge and Homer microservices will be running in the Simpson namespace and Selma and Patty microservices will be running in the Bouvier namespace.

* Provision Namespace and ArgoProjects for the demo:

```sh
oc apply -k argo-projects/
```

NOTE: if you deployed in the early exercise this application, you can skip to the Egress Firewall step directly.

* Login to the ArgoCD Server:

```sh
echo https://$(oc get route openshift-gitops-server -n openshift-gitops -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}{"\n"}')
```

* Use admin user with the password:

```sh
oc get secret/openshift-gitops-cluster -n openshift-gitops -o jsonpath='\''{.data.admin\.password}'\'' | base64 -d
```

NOTE: you can also login using the Openshift SSO because it's enabled using Dex OIDC integration.

* Deploy the ApplicationSet containing the Applications to be secured:

```sh
oc apply -f argo-apps/dev-env-apps.yaml
```

* Check that the applications are deployed properly in ArgoCD:

* Check the pods are up && running:

```sh
oc get pods -o wide -n simpson
oc get pods -o wide -n bouvier
```

* Check that the apps are working properly:

```sh
oc -n bouvier exec -ti deploy/patty-deployment -- ./container-helper check
oc -n bouvier exec -ti deploy/selma-deployment -- ./container-helper check
oc -n simpson exec -ti deploy/homer-deployment -- ./container-helper check
oc -n simpson exec -ti deploy/selma-deployment -- ./container-helper check
```

* You can check each Argo Application in ArgoCD:

* As you can check all the communications are allowed between microservices:

```sh
marge.simpson             : 1
selma.bouvier             : 1
patty.bouvier             : 1
```

the 1, means that the traffic is OK, and the 0 are the NOK.

## Implementing Network Security Zones in OpenShift

Application pods run on one OpenShift Cluster. Micro-segmented with Network Security policies.

Infra Nodes in each zone run Ingress and Egress pods for specific zones

If required, physical isolation of pods to specific nodes is possible with node-selectors. But that defeats the purpose of a shared cluster. Micro-segmentation with SDN is the way to go.
